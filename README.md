# Transformer-2D-Blackboard-Reasoning
Research repository for the DL 2025 course project. The goal is to train transformers to use a 2D blackboard for better reasoning capabilities.

## Structure
Please update this section when extending the project folder.
### projectlib
Contains helper functions and serves as the project code library. Everything that is reused between models/runs should go there.
### datasets
Contains scripts to generate datasets and the generated datasets (preferrably as pytorch datasets)
